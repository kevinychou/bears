A FastAI project from Week 2: Production. Bear classifier app which allows user to upload image, and determines whether image is grizzly, teddy, or black bear.

## Mini Blog
Main difficulties included getting Binder and Voila to work together. Key learning points:
- Looking at Voila model examples (and directly from the fastai book) and replicating was very useful.
- Being more meticulous with following the video (main issue was leaving Binder url as "FILE" instead of "URL")
- Shorterning feedback loop is incredibly important to reduce frustration.
